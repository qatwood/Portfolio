# Data Wrangling of Artificial Pancreas Medical Data
## Project Description
A project done as part of CSE 572 - Data Mining 

Created a machine learning model that performs classification on data extracted from an Artificial Pancreas Medical Control System. 
Utilized data wrangling and mining tools (cleaning, balancing, pruning and feature extraction) to prepare data for machine learning. Classification distinguish two types of data in the dataset (meal and no meal data). The two datasets used contain 55,000 entry points and 40,000.

## Models implemented
Supervised Learning: 
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K Neighbors
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Technology Used
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
