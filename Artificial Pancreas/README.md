# Data Wrangling of Artificial Pancreas Medical Data
## Project Description
<!--- 
In the United States, about 1.6 million Americans live with Type 1 Diabetes. Type 1 Diabetes is an autoimmune disease that affects insulin production in the pancreas. 

A healthy pancreas controls insulin production automatically, therfore controlling the blood sugar levels in the body. People living with Type 1 Diabetes have pancreas that fails to perform this function, leaving them having to continuously watch out for every bite of food and exercise they do to keep blood sugar levels at the proper level.

This means using finger pricks to measure blood-sugar levels, ideally 6 six times a day or more, then carefully balancing insulin intake with eating and activities. It requires a very strict regimen. Even amongst the most disciplined, people with type 1 diabetes still experience dangerously high or low blood-glucose levels that can be life threatening.

Before the medical advance of an "artificial pancreas", insulin delivery was performed in the form of needle injection following a manual calculation of the amount required. Artificial pancreas have automated this process by using data science to measure blood glucose level in the body and perform timed delivery of insulin, improving quality of life of its users.

A project done as part of CSE 572 - Data Mining 

Created a machine learning model that performs classification on data extracted from an Artificial Pancreas Medical Control System. 
Utilized data wrangling and mining tools (cleaning, balancing, pruning and feature extraction) to prepare data for machine learning. Classification distinguish two types of data in the dataset (meal and no meal data). The two datasets used contain 55,000 entry points and 40,000.

## Models implemented
Supervised Learning: 
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K Neighbors
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Technology Used
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
