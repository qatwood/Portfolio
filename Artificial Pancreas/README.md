# Data Wrangling of Artificial Pancreas Medical Data
## Project Description
<!--- 
In the United States, about 1.6 million Americans live with Type 1 Diabetes. Type 1 Diabetes is an autoimmune disease that affects insulin production in the pancreas. 

A healthy pancreas controls insulin production automatically, therfore controlling the blood sugar levels in your body. People living with Type 1 Diabetes have to continuously watch out for every bite of food they eat and every exercise they do to keep blood sugar levels at the proper level.

This means measuring blood-sugar levels through finger pricks, ideally 6 six times a day or more, then carefully balancing insulin intake with eating, exercise and other activities. It requires a very strict regimen. Even so, people with type 1 diabetes still experience dangerously high or low blood-glucose levels that can be life threatening.

most diabetes patients have to regualry take insulin in the form of injection

a medical advanced was found, that relies heavily on data science tools.

this device called an artificial pancreas automate the process.. improving quality of life..

A project done as part of CSE 572 - Data Mining 

Created a machine learning model that performs classification on data extracted from an Artificial Pancreas Medical Control System. 
Utilized data wrangling and mining tools (cleaning, balancing, pruning and feature extraction) to prepare data for machine learning. Classification distinguish two types of data in the dataset (meal and no meal data). The two datasets used contain 55,000 entry points and 40,000.

## Models implemented
Supervised Learning: 
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K Neighbors
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Technology Used
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
