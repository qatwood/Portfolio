In the climbing community, the debate of height, weight to ability has existed for a long time. 
The chatter has increased even more so now with the rising number of the community.
A few articles have discussed what many in the climbing community feels to be true: 
It's a strength to weight ratio that favors people of average height.

In this project, I attempt to visualize height and weight in comparison to how "strong" a climber is. 
The data I retrieved is from 8a.nu, one of the largest data logging websites for the climbing community.

I use excel, python and tableau.
