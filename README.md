# Data Mining of Artificial Pancreas Medical Data
## Project Description
A project done as part of CSE 572 - Data Mining 

Created a machine learning model that performs classification on data extracted from an Artificial Pancreas Medical Control System. 
Utilized data wrangling and mining tools (feature extraction, cleaning, balancing, pruning) to prepare data to be used for machine learning. Classification distinguished between two types of data in the dataset (meal and no meal data). The two datasets used contain 55,000 entry points and 40,000.

## Models implemented
Supervised Learning: 
Decision Tree Classifier
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier.

## Technology Used
Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
